      <p className="mt-4 text-[var(--ink)]/80">
          Ontario Taraweeh Outreach is a dedicated initiative created to connect Huffadh, Imams, Ulamaa, and Quraan teachers with Masajid, Musallahs, Islamic centres, and Madaris across Ontario and throughout North America. <br /><br />
          Our mission is simple: to strengthen our communities by making it easier for institutions to find qualified individuals, and for individuals to find meaningful opportunities to serve.<br /><br />

          Across the region, communities consistently seek knowledgeable Ulamaa, Imams, and teachers to serve in essential roles—teaching in Madaris, delivering Jumu‘ah khutbahs, conducting programs, leading prayers, and offering spiritual mentorship.<br /><br />

          Our goal is to support the growth and stability of Islamic institutions by ensuring they are empowered with dedicated individuals who can enrich their programs and spiritual services.</p>
  
       <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[var(--brand)]">Our Vision</h1>
       <p className="mt-4 text-[var(--ink)]/80">
       We envision a region where every Masjid, Musallah, and Madrasah can find the right people at the right time with ease, and where every Hafidh, Imam, and scholar has access to opportunities that help them teach, lead, and grow. By fostering these connections, we hope to strengthen the spiritual fabric of our communities and promote excellence in Islamic service throughout Canada and beyond.</p>
